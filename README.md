# Ribbon-Final-Fork

## Setup for Local Development
### Installing and running the repository
### Technologies used
* This project was built using MongoDB, Mongoose, Express, EJS


This was a work in progress. It started as a colaborative project build by a team of three and continued by @eff-diggity. We used input from the client to decide on foundational features. We settled on a way for clients to sign in, a way for clients to message the admin, and a searchable blog. 

I started learning EJS, MongoDb, and Express were all new tech for me. I crash-coursed myself in bootstrap, and therefore the styling is going to continue to get fine tuned. 

Right now the /searchResults page doesn't render in the main.ejs template. To use go in, un-comment /ribbonController.js line 67 to run a search, it will render as raw data. You gotta restart re-comment it and restart the run in the browser between each search to keep exploring. 

Similarly, the contact info  renders in the  browser without styling after hitting "send". 

The future plans are: 
1) Once signed in clients can see and edit their personal info.
2) Portal for Admin to sign in an directly update blog.
3) Commerce capabilities for virtual and physical products.
4) Continue the styling journey prorotizing the contact and search results pages....
